As an administrator,
I want to register The Huxleyâ€™s students
So that I can manage the students

Scenario: new students
Given that i am logged as a Admin user, "admin", with password "123456"
And that i am at the "Register students" page
And "Rafael Mota Alves" is registered in The Huxley's group
When I try to upload a "XLS" file with columns "TheHuxleyName" and "LoginCin" and an entry of "Rafael Mota Alves" and "rma7" for those columns respectively
Then I can see "Rafael Mota Alves" with login "rma7" in the registered students list
